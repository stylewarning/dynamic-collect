                                NOTES

This software is really in alpha stage. I don't think the API is
perfect yet, neither are the semantics.

Also, I am not sure if a bare COLLECT form should error, saying that
it is not a part of a WITH-DYNAMIC-COLLECTION form, or if it should
just return NIL. Erroring out is useful in order to determine
accidental usage, but returning NIL is useful if we don't necessarily
want to always be collecting. Right now it is configurable.
