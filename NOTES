                                NOTES

This software is really in alpha stage. I don't think the API is
perfect yet, neither are the semantics. For example, there are some
warnings if we try to nest the constructs.

Another major issue is the lack of composition. We cannot really
compose several collectors because we only have one COLLECT function,
which can't differentiate between the different
WITH-DYNAMIC-COLLECTION forms. I am not sure if this is a desirable or
necessary feature, though.

Finally, I am not sure if a bare COLLECT form should error, saying
that it is not a part of a WITH-DYNAMIC-COLLECTION form, or if it
should just return NIL. Erroring out is useful in order to determine
accidental usage, but returning NIL is useful if we don't necessarily
want to always be collecting.
